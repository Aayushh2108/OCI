  <h1 class="title">T-20 Information</h1>
  <h1> Twenty20 International</h1>
  <p>Twenty20 (T20) is a shortened game format of cricket. At the professional level, it was introduced by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in 2003 for the inter-county competition. 
    In a Twenty20 game, the two teams have a single innings each, which is restricted to a maximum of 20 overs.</p> 

    <p>A Twenty20 International (T20I) is a form of cricket, played between two of the international members of the International Cricket Council (ICC), in which each team faces a maximum of twenty overs.
         The matches have top-class status and are the highest T20 standard. The game is played under the rules of Twenty20 cricket. 
         Starting from the format's inception in 2005, T20I status only applied to Full Members and some Associate Member teams. However, in April 2018,
          the ICC announced that it would grant T20I status to all its 105 members from 1 January 2019.</p>
